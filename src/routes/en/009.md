Weekend Challenge --- Round Two!

## Surreal politics

This week I participated again in the <a href="https://blenderartists.org/c/contests/weekend-challenge/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weekend Challenge</a>. The topic **surrealism** was a little more abstract:

<Image d = {{ postId: '009', filename: '009-A',
	alt: 'The imaginations of an older man, who tries to digest somehow all the bad news the world is producing currently',
	cap: 'Title: "News Overdose"'
}} />

### Difficult topic?

Yes, for sure. It wasn't exactly a success, by all means. Maybe it is not ok to bring political stuff to such an art challenge, or it was because of the implementation. Which may lack a little...

The main character is not a good attempt, with more patience I'd probably have him redone from scratch. The background feels like a pretty quick an dirty job (it wasn't even!). The action below the table is partially okay -- but it takes just a third of the whole image.

And here are some fatal flaws as well: The knives are due to bad perspective barely recognizable, the mushroom clouds I did as last, and my lack of motivation clearly shows -- the whole image took quite some time.

But well, I'm not complaining, it was a fun experiment, and I like the image by and large -- that counts for me. And let's see what is on the menu next week.
