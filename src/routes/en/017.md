## Art challenge submissions pt.2

No long introduction, instead the next two submissions for the discord art challenge. I won't do anymore of these actually, since I left the server. I am quite the opposite of a discord-fan, so it's always kinda difficult. But, that's no blog topic.

Instead, pics!

### Secret Ways

My 2nd entry. Some simple architecture, color assignments have been quite the puzzle, because I didnt want different objects to touch on areas of same colour as much as possible. The mirror is done lazy unfortunately, definitely doable within palette limits.

The palette (*Ink*):

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '017', filename: '017-A.png',
	alt: 'Ink',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/ink'
}} />

And the image:

<Image d = {{ postId: '017', filename: '017-B',
	alt: 'Isometric view of a modern apartment, no ceiling and walls with half height, like in a toy house. The used palette has just very few colors.',
	cap: 'Secret Ways'
}} />

### Steampunk

A few weeks later, next submission. Palette (*Nyx8*):

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '017', filename: '017-C.png',
	alt: 'Nyx8',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/nyx8'
}} />

And the image:

<Image d = {{ postId: '017', filename: '017-D',
	alt: 'Weird steampunk vehicle, half tank half train, in the desert',
	cap: 'Steampunk'
}} />

I have images for 2-3 more posts, these will appear here during the next days or weeks. Hope you are all using that RSS-button! :)
