Substantial progress!

## A fitting modifier stack

Based on the last attempt I reworked the modifier stack slightly, and walls with irregular heights and depths are the result, the occasional chaotic spot included. For the floor and ceiling I changed some parameters, so they are noticeably more flat overall.

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-B',
	alt: 'the walls have an slightly chaotic surface, flat, rectangular protusions and cavities; these details are all procedurally generated',
	cap: 'Isolated corridor walls'
}} />

Working on the more complex wall model, some problems occured after using the boolean modifier several times to cut holes. Blender crashed whenever I entered edit mode. Now blenders recovery options are very good, so it was no drama, but still annoying. Even applying all modifiers didn't help. I was able to cut more holes via bools into the walls, but it left gaps and I had to add filler objects to cover them.

Next time I will do the wall from several parts. in case this will result in bad blending (which I consider likely), I'll just shift the wall parts into each other slightly and cover bad spots with other objects. My overall messy graphic style will prove forgiving here. Also I am confident I can avoid crashes this way.

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-A',
	alt: 'Functionality of the procedural wall detail generation showcased on the default cube, illustrated from four different points of view',
	cap: 'Wall structure on the default cube, two meters edge length'
}} />

### Floor and ceiling

As mentioned, these are made from the same modifierstack but with different parameters. The texture-based displacement is down-tuned a lot.

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-C',
	alt: 'Instead of the walls now the floor and ceiling are shown in an isolated manner; the details are more even, the overall impression is much flatter',
	cap: 'Floor and ceiling; downtuned details, in comparison to the walls'
}} />

### Other objects

To avoid repetition, a lot of devices are placed against the walls. They have to fit well to the walls, style-wise, so this means: not too many details, an overall messy style (done with help of displacement modifier), no parallel edges, no 90Â°-corners and no use of bevel-modifier.

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-D',
	alt: 'Now walls, floor and ceiling are excluded from view and the objects and equipment are shown free-floating: consoles, pipes, hoses, some kind of shelf',
	cap: 'equipment installed inside the corridor'
}} />

## Different styles

Since there are only humans in my fictive universe, all ships have a similar construction style.

Still there needs to be a difference between a shabby pirate ship with lots of makeshift-constructions and -repairs, and an expensive corvette which is part of a government fleet, in which you can eat from the floor.

I will probably tune the modifiers of the walls down, so they appear more regular, and will use a more coherent style for the devices, to make the difference easily visible.

## Final result / next steps

Who got until here may look at two images from the inside of the complete corridor:

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-E',
	alt: 'Now everything comes together, from the inside, with good view along the corridor; but everything is still in grey shades, without realistic lighting or any kind of colorizing',
	cap: 'complete corridor from inside, PoV 1'
}} />

<Image d = {{ postId: '006', filename: '006-F',
	alt: 'similar image as before, but this time from the other side of the corridor',
	cap: 'complete corridor from inside, PoV 2'
}} />

Next step is texturizing/colorizing. Which style it will be in the end, I can't tell yet. Inbetween-results will tell. I'll write about the failed attempts shorter this time, probably in a single post.
