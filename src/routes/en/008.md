And for a change of scene, this time something different.

## Weekend Challenge: Snails

On blenderartists.org is a weekly contest called <Link href="https://blenderartists.org/c/contests/weekend-challenge/25" >Weekend Challenge</Link>. To get more experience with lowpoly modelling, I decided to participate (more or less) regular. This weeks topic: **Snail**

<Image d = {{ postId: '008', filename: '008-A',

### Stubborn gras

One thing that bothers me are the grass blades, which penetrate each other. The problem is not exactly trivial, about the optimal solution I am not sure yet. Maybe it's a question of design, giving them a shape that invites that particular behavior much less. Or it's a question of better placement algorithms, or just a matter of more dedicated clean-up in the end.
