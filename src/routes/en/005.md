## Project corridor back on track

<Image d = {{ postId: '005', filename: '005-A',
	alt: 'the new corridor from inside',
	cap: 'new corridor: proper elements on floor, walls and ceiling'
}} />

I went on with some fresh ideas for my modifier stack. Also I changed the overall construction recipe. This time it is not all-in-one-go, but rather first scaffold, then fill in the gaps. And, for the floor I varied the modifier stack slightly, to separate it more from the walls.

<Image d = {{ postId: '005', filename: '005-B',
	alt: 'two wall elements displayed in isolation, one as simple 2D-shape (no modifiers), one with active modifiers; to the right the modifier stack inside blender\'s UI: Solidify, Remesh, Displace, Decimate',
	cap: 'wall elements with and without modifiers'
}} />


### yummy techy modifier stack

This attempt satisfies the "do you look SF?"-condition good enough. I can't overuse it, it would probably get boring to have each wall look like that. But I guess I can say that about every single style; the combination is going to do it.

<Image d = {{ postId: '005', filename: '005-C',
	alt: 'Camera pointed upwards, so the separate elements that make up walls and ceiling are better visible',
	cap: 'scaffolding structures in walls and ceiling'
}} />

So I will be using this as part of my to-go-strategy. And, possibly for the outer side of spaceship hulls. It has all the greebles.

### two-step construction

<Image d = {{ postId: '005', filename: '005-D',
	alt: 'view from outside',
	cap: 'from outside the scaffolding structure is less clear visible'
}} />

I learned a good lession here. In hindsight it is pretty trivial, though: If you want to get some varied results outputted, you can't input just a single thing. I expected a little too much from my (script-less) procedural generation here. But that's what studies are for, right.
