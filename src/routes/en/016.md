## Blog revived!

It's about seven months, since I wrote the last post on this blog! I was partially distracted, partially too lazy to update, to be honest. But I stopped being lazy about my blog (for now, at least!), and since I have some material accumulated, I am going to write a few more posts over the next days, until it's all published.

### Pixelart challenge

Well no, I didn't change my artstyle. But I discovered this weekly challenge on the german-speaking Letsgamedev-Discord. My submissions are lowpoly as I usually do, but I follow the palette-guidelines and have unshaded colors.

My first submission was for the topic *underwater world*, and this is the palette that went with the topic:

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '016', filename: '016-A.png',
	alt: 'MistGB',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/mist-gb'
}} />

I made this animation:

<Video d = {{ postId: '016', filename: '016-video1.mp4' }} />

If the video causes trouble, here a still frame:

<Image d = {{ postId: '016', filename: '016-B',
	alt: 'low poly fish in palette colors under water, a few corals on the ocean ground',
	cap: 'underwater world'
}} />

### Godot!

More news on the gamedev side of things: I started properly learning the <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Game Engine</a>. Started with a bunch of tutorials (and tutorial series), and in meantime I do my own project, but I'll cover that in a later post in more detail!

### What about the old projects?

Generally spoken, on hold for an undetermined amount of time.

The SF2020-project I do work mentally on at least, now and then. My Ink-project is stopped, but doing IF with Ink will very likely happen at some point in future.

Blenderartists' weekend challenge I do not participate in anymore currently, instead I am doing the other one now. But that may change in future, who knows.
