## Art-Challenge-Posts 3

I wrote in the last post, there would not be more images, but I actually meant: Except the ones I have done but just not published yet.

Like, for example, the following three!

### Fox

I'm not sure anymore if I planned to do a whole fox and just decided later to reduce it to head-only, or wanted it like this from beginning. In any case the palette *Tranquil Fantasy 23* with its 23 colors was quite ample to work with:

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-A.png',
	alt: 'Palette Tranquil Fantasy 23',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/tranquil-fantasy-23'
}} />

And the contribution:

<Image d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-B',
	alt: 'lowpoly version of a fox head, on strong-red background, could also be a logo or a flag',
	cap: 'Fox Guevara'
}} />

### Warrior

The next iteration of the challenge featured the topic *Warrior* and was meant to be done with usage of *Old 90's* palette which you can see here:

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-C.png',
	alt: 'Palette Old 90'+"'"+'s',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/old90s'
}} />

And the contribution:

<Image d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-D',
	alt: 'a robot-baby-chicken on a colorful 70ies carpet, looking upwards',
	cap: 'Warrior'
}} />

More like a wanna-be-warrior (at the time of writing)!

There is a detail different at the last two images, as you may have noticed. Instead of using the usual colorized surfaces, I made and used some actual pixelart textures.

That is quite a bit more efford (nothing beats just slapping flat colors on everything, I guess), and my workflow surely can be optimized, but in general it is a nice change. For the following image I returned back to old way though.

### Dystopia

Topic is in the title, and this is the palette named *Lemon-16*:

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-E.png',
	alt: 'palette Lemon-16',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/lemon-16'
}} />

And the contribution:

<Image d = {{ postId: '018', filename: '018-F',
	alt: 'a lodge on a soon flooded land tongue, in the background, inside the choppy sea is the tip of another, almost drowned building. Next to the first building is a tornado raging',
	cap: 'Dystopia'
}} />


That's it for today, there will be at least one more post with images (or even videos?!) from the pixelart challenge.
