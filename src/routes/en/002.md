In this attempt I am breaking one of my own rules: No flat-colour style, instead I am working with gradients.

## segments and gradients

<Image d = {{ postId: '002', filename: '002-A',
	alt: 'a wall with cell structure and gradients in close-up',
	cap: 'gradients seem to be worth another try, I think'
}} />

**Summary:** I like the idea of using gradients as a simple way of texturing. One downside is, I introduce UV-unwrapping to my workflow (though in a simple and quick way). But still, my other ideas of how to bring color on the meshes, is flat-color-style, which lets me avoid UV-unwrapping at all.

I may do experiments with gradients again. Also I think, there is a way to create them via nodes in blender. The downside may be a huge amount of materials, but I didn't investigate that too closely.

<Image d = {{ postId: '002', filename: '002-B',
	alt: 'cloned the wall, connected both walls with a basic floor, put the camera in another place',
	cap: 'the wall got extended to a rudimentary corridor'
}} />

### gradients

I picked a color palette, which is pretty popular in the pixelart genre, namely <em>Dawnbringer's 8 color palette</em>:

<ImageLink d = {{ postId: '002', filename: '002-palette.png',
	alt: 'Dawnbringer 8',
    url: 'https://lospec.com/palette-list/dawnbringers-8-color'
}} />

I then created gradients between pairs of colors of that palette.

<Image d = {{ postId: '002', filename: '002-C',
	alt: 'texture with 8 color fields in the first row, the next 15 rows consisting of horizontal gradients, based on two colors of the original pallete each',
	cap: 'in the first row the original palette, then several gradients created out of the palette'
}} />

For the creation of the gradients, I found it very helpful, to use a software that allows for different ways of getting from color A to color B. Depending on the pairing, RGB transition looked often worse than HSV-clockwise or HSV-counter-clockwise. I used GIMP for creation of the gradients.

### segmented walls

I don't like. It looks like some sad modern art attempt at stained glass. Neither science fiction, nor the style I envision. Of course, I may re-use it for some obscure scenery/objects, when I see fit.

Also, it was not so quick to create as I first thought. But as always, if your workflow iterates and matures, things go a lot faster usually.
