This time I'll deal with two entries at once. Link to the contest is <a href="https://blenderartists.org/c/contests/weekend-challenge/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## Paranormal

<Image d = {{ postId: '012', filename: '012-A',
	alt: 'a kind of ghost in green and purple, looking a bit like glowing bed sheets',
	cap: 'Topic: "paranormal"; title: "laundry gone crazy"'
}} />

For the "paranormal" entry I mostly played with materials a bit. Originally I aimed for a distinct lowpoly look as usual, but the transparencies looked weird and very busy.

## Fragments

<Image d = {{ postId: '012', filename: '012-B',
	alt: 'a bleak landscape falling apart, the ruin of an apartment block, someone installed some letters, speaking: "Too few, too little"',
	cap: 'Topic: "Fragments"; title: "You have 1 unread notifications"'
}} />

The last image with a political statement (*News Overdose*) didn't went well at all in terms of competition (0%). Though I was the only one with 0% at least! Nevertheless I tried it again, for the topic "fragments" I got in mind a shattered earth crust, and evolved that into an image about an ecologic catastrophe. Let's see how this one goes.
