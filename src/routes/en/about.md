## What is this site about?

It is mostly a self motivation project. Also I like whipping up my own website. Here I am writing about progresses, setbacks and experiments on various ongoing projects.

## What projects?

Mostly it's about 3D, game development, website development, animations, writing and text adventures (or interactive fiction).

Some of the tags are not self-explanatory, so let's collect all this here:

### SF2020

An animation project. Topic is "space opera" in the broadest sense, the whole thing being in lowpoly style. At first a lots of stuff needs to be modelled, followed by characters, then some animation tests, and then some story and plot. Ideally I have some episodes of probably a few minutes length to present in the end.

### Weekend Challenge

A weekly contest hosted at the forum <a href="https://blenderartists.org/c/contests/weekend-challenge/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blenderartists.org</a>. Nothing to win, the competition is mostly fierce (not me though)!

### IF

IF is an acronym for 'interactive fiction', also known as text adventure. It's a very text-heave computer game genre, and can work well completely without graphics.
