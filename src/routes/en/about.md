### What is this site about?

It is mostly a self motivation project. Also I like whipping up my own website. Here I am writing about progresses, setbacks and experiments on various ongoing projects.


### What projects?

Mostly it's about 3D, game development, website development, animations, writing and text adventures (or interactive fiction).

### Anything else?

This a purely private, static website. Commenting is not possible, third party content is not embedded *(but may be linked, for example when I upload something to youtube or elsewhere)*.
