A concept for an entirely different kind of setting.

## Spaceship of the cavemen

<Image d = {{ postId: '003', filename: '003-A',
	alt: '"cave" from outside, rendered partially transparent',
	cap: 'an accidentally very organic style'
}} />

Blender has 3 render engines out of the box:

The **workbench engine** is the fastest and most limited; it's main purpose is to run blenders 3D view. Since I want a non-realistic simple visual style for my series, it was worth a shot trying out workbench though.

So far *(and in future)* I use the **EEVEE** render engine. EEVEE hits a sweet spot between quality and speed. In a way it is comparable with modern game graphics.

The third render engine in blender is **Cycles**. Cycles is fully PBR *(physically-based rendering)*, very realistic looking and therefore sort of slow. I don't need photo&shy;realism though *(and if I do, I wiggle my way around it)*, and my 2017-mid range PC would ask for too much of my patience, if I'd use Cycles.

<Image d = {{ postId: '003', filename: '003-B',
	alt: 'View from inside, opaque rendered, with a green element as visual highlight (still not looking good)',
	cap: 'Cave-spaceship from inside'
}} />

### Cavelike ?!

I call a certain kind of failure caused by a modifier stack which won't fit the envisioned solution well, a ... cavelike. Of course whenever caves are needed, and that is not unlikely, I will return here, but I wanted to create a space ship corridor. It doesn't look like one.

### Workbench engine

I am not going to use that. It lacks proper shadows, I can't have glass, I can't have light emissions, all my styling options basically boil down to "give the whole scene a distinct look/color grading", which is too uniform.

<Image d = {{ postId: '003', filename: '003-C',
	alt: 'Same scene as before, perspective slightly changed, and different render settings, it\'s a bit brighter now',
	cap: 'abgeÃ¤nderte different render settings for the workbench engine'
}} />

While this turned out to be a dead end, it was a nice refresher of the possibilities of the workbench engine.
